R code
shapiro.test(myseeds[,7])


Output:
Shapiro-Wilk normality test


data:  myseeds[, 7]
W = 0.92719, p-value = 6.362e-07


Result: We reject normality
Step 1: H0 : Groove length is Normal vs HA : Groove length is Not Normal.
Step 2: Test Statistics : 
shapiro.test(g_length)  # g_length is variable that has groove length.
Step 3: p-Value
Step 4: Decision
Since p-value is less than .05 - We Reject Null Hypothesis
Step 5 : Conclusion
There is statistically significant evidence that groove length is not normal




d)
shapiro.test(myseeds[,4])


Shapiro-Wilk normality test

        m-out-of-n bootstrap symmetry test by Miao, Gel, and Gastwirth (2006)


data:  myseeds[, 4]
Test statistic = 3.7105, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: the distribution is asymmetric.
sample estimates:
bootstrap optimal m 
                 26 


So normality/symmetry is violated, we use bootstrap 
bootmean <- rep(0,150)
for (i in 1:1000)
{
bootmean[i] <- mean(sample(myseeds[,4], replace=TRUE))
12
}
sort(bootmean)[c(1.5, 148.5)]


Output @ 99% CI
5.518313 5.591760


e)
Step 1: H0 :  Length = 5 vs HA : Mean Length > 5
Step 2: Test Statistics
Step 3 ; finding p values
Step 4: P value less
Step 5: we reject null hypothesis as we have significant evidence that mean is great than 5
shapiro.test(myseeds[,4])
Pvalue 1.398e-05






library(lawstat)
> symmetry.test(myseeds[,4])
Pvalue 2.2e-16
Both Normality and Symmetricity is violated. So we do permutation test using oneSamplePermutationTest
library(EnvStats)
oneSamplePermutationTest(myseeds[,4],alternative = 'greater',mu=5)


p-value=0
 Step 4: Decision
Since p-value is less than .05 - We Reject Null Hypothesis


f)
R code:
shapiro.test(myseeds[myseeds[,8]=='1',4])
shapiro.test(myseeds[myseeds[,8]=='2',4])
shapiro.test(myseeds[myseeds[,8]=='3',4])


Normality is not rejected for the three., Since they are independent we are checking equal variance 
types <- c(rep('1',50), rep('2',50), rep('3',50))


Output:
p-value = 0.2534
p-value = 0.3929
p-value = 0.9289




levene.test(myseeds[,4],types)
p-value = 0.000863,  not equal variances
Normality - Not Equal Varaine - Therefore Welch Test.
oneway.test(myseeds[,4]~types)


F = 202.44, num df = 2.000, denom df = 90.555, p-value < 2.2e-16
Reject the null
Step 1: H0 :  Length = 5 vs HA : Mean Length > 5
Step 2: Test Statistics :
Step 3: find p value= 2.2e-16
Step 4: reject Null
Step 5:There is statistically significant evidence that length is different for three varieties.
